#This game is a short memory game (simon) which it is based off of 

#To start the game click any key and the game will start 

#Click the button that lights up as they go in a sequence 

## To download (im not sure) as this is my first time making a read me 

#I would just download the repo and open it in vs code and run the index.html to run it!
